# Crusader-Kings-Access
An accessibility mod for Crusader Kings 3 to make the game fully accessible to the blind and visually impaired, without the use of OCR

#Disclaimer:  This mod is still unfinished and is far from usable.

#Installation:

1.  Download the source code and rename Game to Crusader-Kings-Access

2.  Copy the renamed directory, and put it in your CK3 mod folder.

This can be found in C:\Users\User\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings 3\mod

3.  Change the first line of the main.py file to include your debug.log file's absolute path

an example filepath is C:\Users\User\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings 3\logs\debug.log

4.  Launch Crusader Kings 3 in debug mode.  Instructions on how to do this can be found at https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3-cheats-debug-mode-and-console-commands

5.  Run main.py

note: you will likely get many errors saying the proper package is not installed.  Simply install all required packages as you get the appropriate errors

6.  An invisible window is created on top of your crusader kings window.  To make sure there is no obstruction, alt tab to the ck3 window, then back to the ck3 access window
